# Devolutions PowerShell Script Library

Welcome to the Devolutions PowerShell Script Library! This repository contains a curated collection of PowerShell scripts designed to streamline tasks for IT professionals. Each script is focused on a specific functionality, helping users manage and automate tasks in environments such as Active Directory, Cloud services (AWS, Azure), Networking, Security, and more.

## Expectations for Users

- **Scope**: Each script in this library is intended to accomplish a single task. Users should understand the functionality of each script before use.
- **Complexity**: Scripts are kept simple to ensure reliability and ease of understanding. They do not cover edge cases but are designed for typical use cases.
- **Customization**: Users may need to customize scripts to fit their specific environment or requirements.

## How to Use the Scripts

1. **Clone the Repository**: To get started, clone this repository to your local machine or download individual scripts as needed.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devolutions/PowerShellScriptLibrary.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Script**: Each script is categorized by its use case. Find the script that suits your needs in the corresponding directory.
3. **Read the Documentation**: Before running a script, read the embedded comment-based help to understand its purpose, parameters, and output.

## Caveats

- **Testing**: While scripts are tested in controlled environments, they may behave differently in your specific configuration. Always test scripts in a non-production environment before full deployment.
- **Dependencies**: Some scripts may require additional modules or specific PowerShell versions. Ensure you meet these requirements before execution.
